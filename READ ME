This folder contain the code for the GUI (interface graphique.py) as well as all the function need for it to run.

For the moment the GUI work only with single file (we canont plot the result from multiple animal at the same time)

the structure of the folder is folowing:

Behaviour--> Group XX --> XXX (mouse number) --> Fixed Delay --> XXX (protocole type P15 for exemple) ---> all the behavioural files.
                                                 Random Delay


Ephy--> Group XX --> XXX (CM16_Buz - Female) --> Experiment --> Fixed Delay --> XXX (protocole type) --> all the elec
                                                                Random Delay

The GUI won't work if the foler structure is different
